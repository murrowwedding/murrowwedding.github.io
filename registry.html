          <!--<h3>Honeyfund</h3>-->
          <p>We are so blessed to already have a lot of the items we'll need to
            start our lives together. So, as an alternative, we'd really appreciate
            it if you would check out our Honeyfund page. There, you can help send
            us on the honeymoon of our dreams.</p>
          <p>On our Honeyfund page we have broken down our trip expenses into cost 
            effective single gifts. If you choose to give us a Honeyfund gift, simply 
            use the "Give..." dropdown on the item you wish to pledge for and select the 
            number of gifts you wish to give. This will take you to a payment page. 
            Our Honeyfund does accept credit or debit card purchases via the secure online
            payment platform WePay. If you do not feel secure filling in your credit card 
            information, we totally understand. You can still pledge cash or a check.
            Simply pledge as above and on the payment screen, click the "More options" link 
            next to "Pay with Credit Card". This will switch it to cash or check mode. You can
            then enter your name and email to reserve the gift as well as leave us a message!
            Honeyfund will then generate a gift certificate that you can mail (along with 
            cash or check) to us, or bring to our wedding if you come (we hope you do!).</p>
          <p>We know this isn't your typical wedding registry, but in lieu of gifts
            we would prefer contributions towards our trip to beautiful Nova Scotia. If
            you'd really rather purchase a more traditional wedding gift, we're also
            registered at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Any gift is greatly appreciated!</p>
