          <p>We are so blessed to already have a lot of the items we'll need to
            start our lives together. So, as an alternative, we'd really appreciate
            it if you would check out our Honeyfund page. There, you can help send
            us on the honeymoon of our dreams.</p>
          <p>We know this isn't your typical wedding registry, but in lieu of gifts
            we would prefer contributions towards our trip to beautiful Nova Scotia. If
            you'd really rather purchase a more traditional wedding gift, we're also
            registered at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Any gift is greatly appreciated!</p>
