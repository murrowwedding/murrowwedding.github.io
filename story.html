      <h3>First Met</h3>
      <p>Oklahoma Christian University<br><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"></span> October 1, 2012</p>
      <div class="text-left">
        <p>I was sitting in a practice session for the ACM Programming Competition with my other teammates, Kyler and Silas, and the other competition participants. Professor Harbert walked in with a timid girl with stunning red hair and introduced her to us as someone interested in the competition. I did not catch her name. We continued to work quietly until my team was stumped on a problem, at which time we asked the room for help. The timid girl (still nameless) had figured it out, and I was very impressed! After the practice was over and we went our separate ways, I was determined to find out who she was and, as I told Kyler that same day, date her.</p>
        <p>A few weeks passed and the competition loomed closer. Our team mentor, Professor Leftwich, sent out an email asking for individuals to reply back with their cell numbers, for his record. Thinking I was clever, I used "Reply All" instead of simply "Reply" in hopes that others, including the red-haired girl, would do the same. Unfortunately for me, while others did do the same she did not and I was left without her phone number even still. One good thing did come from this email. Professor Leftwich sent it to everyone coming to the competition and I was able to deduce that her name was Tanya Thompson.</p>
        <p>It was on the bus to the competition that we first introduced ourselves to each other. We didn't speak very much, just in general conversation with others on the bus. I can't remember how I got her number, all I remember is that the night before the conversation we stayed up far too late texting each other. I'm sure the guys I was rooming with didn't appreciate the light from my phone or my soft snickering at her (or my) jokes, but I didn't care. This was just the beginning. We enjoyed the competition (her team did better than mine) and spent the whole bus ride back privately texting each other while conversing out loud with the whole bus. This was the beginning.</p>

A widow of that city came to him repeatedly, saying, 'Give me justice in this dispute with my enemy.'

I'm going to see that she gets justice, because she is wearing me out with her constant requests!'"</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>This verse reflects a term I have coined in getting Tanya to go on a date with me: <strong>persistent annoyance</strong>. We continued to talk in the months following the programming competition and I did everything in my power to get this girl to go on a date with me, which started with getting her to hang out with me. I did get to hang out with her quite a bit, but I wasn't always honest about my reasons for wanting (or needing) to hang out...</p>
        <p>One of my most favorite memories of this time is when I took a programming homework assignment that I had finished correctly, and that I knew Tanya had finished, and introduced errors (removed a few semicolons, for the tech-savvy) into it so that I could ask her to meet me somewhere and help me with it. She asked if she could just send me her code, but I was not having any of it. I was adament to get her to meet up with me. So we met up under OC's pavillion one night for me to get help. Ultimately, we fixed my "problem" and then spent the rest of the night getting to know each other better. It was awesome. It was the first step.</p>
        <p>Come November, my parents had purchased two Trans-Siberian Orchestra tickets for me as an early Christmas present and I thought I had the perfect first date to take Tanya on. She was at her grandparents for Thanksgiving, and TSO would be shortly after her return. I sent her a text over Thanksgiving break akin to "Hey, I like you, will you go on a date with me to a TSO concert in early December?" I received a text back: "Hey, we can go as <em>friends</em>." Dating Tanya was not going to be so easy after all. We did go to that concert as friends and I was more determined than ever to make this girl mine.</p>
        <p>Throughout the next few months, I continued to express interest in a relationship (read: persistently annoy her to date me) and Tanya continued to delay giving me an answer. That's right, she never said "no" but she never said "yes" either. Can you think of anything more frustrating for a teenaged boy? Me neither. We were attached at the hip, though, and our friendship was growing. Finally, in early February I asked her to go on a date with me and she said yes! Ultimately, I am thankful for the time I had to wait because it made the relationship much more important to me. I fought to get her, and I wasn't going to do anything to lose her.</p>

      <h3>First Date</h3>
      <p>Johnny Carino's Italian Restaurant<br><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"></span> February 14, 2013</p>
      <div class="text-left">
        <p>We went to Johnny Carino's on N. May and Memorial. I picked her up at 7. I was wearing nice slacks and a button down shirt with a tie, she was wearing a dress. She looked great. The food was phenomenal and we stayed at the restaurant for at least two hours after we finished our meal, just talking and enjoying each other's company. This date is still my favorite date with Tanya, ever. We've been on many dates since, and one has yet to top this one. I don't remember what we talked about the whole night, but I do have one distinct memory of doodling on a napkin some code, some pokemon, and some dice.</p>
        <p>After the date and back at OC, I again breached the topic of a relationship with Tanya and again I was shut down. My reasoning was something along the lines of "We've just had a wonderful date, why not have many more?" Impeccable logic, I know, but still not enough to sway her, yet.</p>

      <h3>From First Date to Proposal</h3>
      <div class="text-left">
        <p>Finally, on 1 April 2013 (no joke), nearly 6 months since the November I expressed my feelings and first asked her to go on a date with me and two months after our first official date, I asked her yet again about a relationship (looking back, it almost seems like this was a question I asked daily). This time, <strong><em>she finally said yes!!!</em></strong> I did not know this at the time, but later I found out that she had decided to give me a one month trial period (during which I must have done well, considering I am writing this). I'm so glad that she did, but I also enjoy teasing her about it!</p>
        <p>Since then, we were even more inseparable than before (if that is possible). I enjoyed meeting Tanya's family and cooking for them (something I still try to do at least once a visit). I've enjoyed taking Tanya to the lake and sharing with her an integral part of my childhood. She picked up wakeboarding pretty quickly! We've played many a game of D&amp;D together and marathoned Lord of the Rings (extended edition, of course) together at least five times. I love cooking for her and seeing her face light up when she likes something I've made (I think she's the happiest when she's eating). We had countless conversations about whatever came to our mind that would last hours, sometimes late into the night (when we had class early the next day...) and I loved every one of them.</p>
        <p>Tanya and I talked about getting married every now and again. I had planned to propose on her birthday, 17 October 2015, but I didn't tell her this. That night was a Friday night, which is D&amp;D night. I was planning on taking the ring and putting it in a small box that was decorated like a treasure chest. I planned on working that chest into the game that we were playing, and when Tanya encountered it, I would get down on one knee and ask her to marry me. I texted my mom one night in January and asked her if she could have dinner with me after work. We went to Iguana Mexican Grill in OKC and it was there that I told her I wanted to marry Tanya. I told her about the date I had picked out, and she mentioned that it would be helpful if we had the summer of 2015 to plan the wedding. I left that dinner adament in my plan, but just a few days later texted her and told her that I had changed my mind and was going to propose on our anniversary, 1 April 2015.</p>
        <p>Tanya does not like jewelry. This made finding Tanya an engagement ring very difficult for me. I spent a few weeks scouring Zales and other jeweler's websites to find the perfect ring. Finally, I found a simply diamond slant band with beautiful green (her favorite color) emeralds. I knew it was the one.</p>
        <p>I had just one obstacle remaining before I could propose: getting her parents' blessing. I called them and asked if I could come meet with them on a Saturday afternoon. We scheduled a date and I arranged for my dad to fly me down to Greenville. I told Tanya I had to spend the Saturday at home helping dad with some household projects (in actuality, dad was helping me!). We landed at the small airport there and I took the airport car to her house. I was nervous. Her parents had guessed, of course, why I was coming down. We spoke, and they gave their blessing. Thank goodness! I was way more worried about getting them to say yes than I was about getting Tanya to say yes. I got to show her parents and siblings the ring I had bought, and they loved it. </p>

      <h3>Proposal</h3>
      <p>Hafer Park<br><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"></span> April 1, 2015</p>
      <div class="text-left">
        <p>The date was set. The ring was bought. Her parents' blessing was given. Now I just had to plan and execute. Easier said than done. By moving my date up to April, I had significantly lessened my planning time and couldn't do the D&ampD proposal anymore. I had to come up with a new plan.</p>
        <p>Hafer Park in Edmond is absolutely beautiful in the spring. Tanya and I had walked around its trails a few times and I knew it would be a great place to propose. I came up with the idea of a picnic date, during which I would propose. I gathered the supplies: a folding table and chairs from Grandma, an ice chest and sandwich supplies from Wal-Mart, place cards that said "Mr. Murrow" and "Future Mrs. Murrow" on them. I went out to the park after classes, around 4 PM, on the day of the proposal and set everything up. I recruited my roommates to stand guard over the setup in the park and make sure that nobody disturbed it. I had a Jon assigned to taking pictures (covertly, of course) and a Drew assigned to taking video (also covertly) as we approached the table. They had both been briefed on the proposal plan using the diagram (I'm an engineer, give me a break) I drew.</p>
        <p>After setting everything up and doing a dry run with the guys, I left to go pick up Tanya. I made her dress up in a dress (she complained because we were going to the park) and once again she looked gorgeous. We went to the park, but before we sat down for dinner, I took her on a walk around the trails of the park. I made sure to park away from the picnic table and chairs so that she wasn't aware of them. During the walk I recounted to her our story and all the things I loved about her. She was in no mood for romance or niceties, however, because she was hungry. She kept asking me where the food was and when we would get to eat! Finally, we came to the picnic table that I had set up. I set it up so that for her to look at her place card, her back would be to me. While she was looking at her place card, I dropped to one knee and pulled out the ring. When she turned back around, I popped the question!</p>
        <p class="text-center"><strong><em>And she said yes!</em></strong></p>
        <p>I called the guys out of hiding (much to her chagrin, as she found out she had been photographed and videoed) and we took some pictures by the lake before settling down to have our picnic. Funnily enough, she barely ate anything!</p>

      <div class="text-left">
        <p>After doing the UIL programming competitions in high school, I was interested in the ACM programming competition that OC participated in. I spoke with Professor Harbert about being in the competition and after a small delay he was able to get me on a team. Letting me skip lab that day, he showed me to the classroom where the practice was taking place.</p>
        <p>I walked in the door and looking around the room, there were three guys sitting together at one end of a long table and another guy sitting several seats down. I was a little embarrassed because, since we came in late, everyone had turned to look at us. Professor Leftwich, the team mentor, introduced me to the other students.</p>
        <p>The three guys sitting together were Silas, Kyler, and Corbin and were already a team; the other guy by himself was Robert. Leftwich put me to work on some practice problems with Robert, who would be one of my teammates. After a while Robert had to leave, and so I continued working by myself.</p>
        <p>Soon I began to hear conversation from the other team about a problem they were struggling with. I thought to myself, "If I could singlehandedly beat these guys to figuring out this problem, that would be awesome." I spoke up, "Which problem are you guys talking about?" They answered, I turned to the problem to read it. I mumbled "Hmm, oh yeah okay." and began working on a solution.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later I was pretty sure I had it. They were still bickering away, trying to solve the problem. I double- and triple-checked mine, afraid that if I missed anything I would look dumb instead of cool (like I was planning). I piped up, "Hey, I think I got it." They stopped and turned to look at me. With a slightly skeptical face, Corbin wheeled himself across the room (via rolley chair) over beside me. I showed him my code and ran the program. He saw that it worked, and so I told his team how I got my solution.</p>
        <p>Wanting to end the practice on a good note, I decided I should leave. It was time for dinner anyways, so I packed up my things and headed out.</p>
        <p>First impression? <em>Naaaiiiled it.</em></p>

        <h3>From First Met to First Date</h3>
        <div class="text-left">
          <p>On October 19th we left for the programming competition at LeTourneau University in Longview, Texas. When we arrived at the hotel, we ordered pizza for dinner and the teams had a big study session together before the competition the next day. Of course our studying soon dissolved into chatting, and before we knew it it was midnight.</p>
          <p>As we split up to go to our rooms (the other girl and I in one room, and the guys in another) Corbin offered to text one of us when they were going to breakfast. In an event that would <em>change the course of history <strong>forever</strong></em>, I offered my number in exchange. And so our friendship began.</p>
          <p>In the following months, we texted constantly. After the competition he asked if I wanted to sit by him and his friends in our Programming 1 class, so I did. We started working on assignments together when partners were allowed, and got to see each other every other day.</p>
          <p>I remember one instance about a month or so later; he messaged me and asked for help on an assignment. I tried to send my code, but he still couldn't get it to work and wanted me to come look. It made me feel good to be asked for help (only to find out A YEAR later that I was TOTALLY being played). I met him under the big pavilion in the middle of campus where there were tables and chairs.</p>
          <p>(What I didn't find out until after we were dating was that he had simply removed a semicolon or two. <em>Semicolons</em>. He had purposely broken the code just so he would have an excuse for me to come hang out with him. Thankfully for him, apparently I couldn't read a debugger. That little stinker.)</p>
          <p>We spent an hour or more trying to fix his code. I couldn't figure out what was wrong with it, and suggested he email the professor. While we waited for a possible response (which, funnily enough, would never come), we started watching youtube videos and talking about other things. I had fun, but eventually we had to go back to our dorms for curfew. We hadn't hung out outside of class yet, and this was a new step in our friendship.</p>
          <p>Over Thanksgiving break, I finally found out. Corbin messaged me, confessing his feelings for me. He told me that he got Trans-Siberian Orchestra tickets and hoped we could go together for our first date. I didn't know what to say. I didn't have romantic feelings for him or want to be in a relationship at the time, but was afraid of upsetting him. I told him as much, but said I would be glad to go as friends if he didn't have anyone else to invite. We did end up going and it was a lot of fun.</p>
          <p>Over the next few months, he continued to remind me of his feelings and hoped I would be ready to date. Finally he asked me on a date for Valentine's day, and I said yes.</p>

      <div class="text-left">
        <p>We went to Johnny Carino's, an Italian restaurant I had never been to. I was nervous at first. Would this be weird? Would he act differently? Shortly after we were seated, I relaxed and we were soon having fun chatting about our days and how classes went. Eventually the food came out, it was great. Even after we got our ticket, we continued to sit and talk for another hour or so. We doodled on the reciepts, spelling our names in hex and trying to draw Pokemon from memory.</p>
        <p>We left the restaurant, and nervousness sank in again. He brought up dating, saying that night was an example of how our relationship could be. I was still hesitant. I told him I still wasn't ready for that step yet. Thankfully for me, he stuck around and continued trying.</p>

    <div class="event">
      <h3>From First Date to Proposal</h3>
      <div class="text-left">
        <p>In the two months following the date, Corbin was as persistent as ever. Finally on April 1, 2013 the stars aligned and I could say yes to being in a relationship with him. He was thrilled, to say the least. I was excited, but that was largely obscured by being nervous. I would get attention, now that we were official. People might think about me, or worse <em>look at me</em>. Needless to say, the world didn't end and I was perfectly alright. In fact, I was much better.</p>
        <p>We had a blast. We already shared some interests and hobbies, but we also introduced each other to more interests and hobbies. When I met him he hadn't seen Lord of the Rings all the way through, and it <em><strong>had</strong></em> to be remedied. We had more than one Lord of the Rings marathon, througout which Corbin had to endure my endless trivia updates about the movie. We also joined a school group that was playing Pathfinder (similar to D&D). I'd played D&D growing up and loved it, and I was excited for him to experience that as well.</p>
        <p>Corbin introduced me to the world of board games, which was something I never realized I was missing out on. I was accepted into the group that was regularly invited to the engineering professors' houses for games, and Corbin and I attended many a game night together.</p>
        <p>Over the summers, I got to go on lake trips with his family. I learned to wakeboard, and it was AWESOME. I became a pro (at falling). I was also graced with Corbin's amazing cooking. We cooked a lot together - him doing pretty much all of the cooking and directing, and me usually peeling potatoes, stirring a pot, or cleaning up. It was great.</p>
        <p>As we were nearing 2 years together, we talked about marriage more and more. Things we would want in our wedding, what kind of stuff we would put in a house ("We could have a big game room, with all our board games! And a big office for our computers and desks!"). We'd both decided that getting married after graduation would be the best idea, and I'd gotten the impression that he might propose in the fall.</p>

      <h3>Proposal</h3>
      <p>Hafer Park<br><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"></span> April 1, 2015</p>
      <div class="text-left">
        <p>It was our 2-year annivarsary, and to celebrate Corbin suggested we could have a picnic at Hafer Park. We had been there a few times before and walked around the trails; it's a very nice park. He <em>insisted</em> that I dress up nice. If you know me, you probably know that I definitely don't like dressing up and would much rather be in jeans and a t-shirt. I finally agreed and we made the plans to go there for dinner.</p>
        <p>He picked me up at my apartment, but I noticed that there was no food in his car. I thought we might be going to the store but we just went straight to the park. We parked on the opposite side of the park from the pond, near one of the trails. He led me onto the trail and we started walking. I started asking about our food (I was starving, of course) but he wouldn't answer my questions. That's when I knew something was up.</p>
        <p>We walked and talked; about what I don't remember exactly. I was too hungry and pestered him to tell me where our food was - or <strong>if</strong> he had even brought any! He still would not tell me anything about our food. Can you think of anything more frustrating for a teenaged girl? Me neither.</p>
        <p>The trail led us to the pond, and as we rounded the corner I saw a table and two chairs set up in the grass. I knew it had to be ours (I sure hoped it was anyways), and sure enough we headed towards it. Now that the food was in sight, a million more questions came to mind. The most important of which was: <em>what if someone had taken our food??</em></p>
        <p>As we got to the table, I saw placeholders; the one on this side said "Mr. Murrow". I got around to my side and had to do a double-take; my placeholder didn't say "Ms. Thompson", but something else. I read "Future Mrs. Murrow" and stood confused for a second. It suddenly dawned on me, and as I turned around Corbin was already down on one knee! I was totally surprised, but when I found the words to speak again I said yes!</p>
