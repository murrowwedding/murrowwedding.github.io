    <p>Corbin is studying Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science at Oklahoma Christian University. His hobbies include D&amp;D, board games and video games, as well as electronics projects and asking Tanya to paint, draw, or make something (like this website) for him (or one of his hobbies).</p>

      <h3>First Met</h3>
      <p>After doing the UIL programming competitions in high school, I was interested in the ACM programming competition that OC participated in. </p>

      <h3>Proposal</h3>
      <p>It was our 2-year annivarsary, and Corbin said we could have a picnic at the park. He brought me there, but hadn't brought any food! We walked and talked around one of the trails, and all the while I kept asking where our food was (I was starving, of course). When we got around to the pond, I saw that he had already set up our picnic. As we got to the table, I saw placeholders with our names on them. I got around to my side, and had to do a double-take; my placeholder didn't say "Tanya", but instead "Future Mrs. Murrow". I turned around, and he was down on one knee! I was totally surprised, but when I realized what was happening, I said yes!</p>
