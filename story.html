    <p>Corbin is studying Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science at Oklahoma Christian University. His hobbies include D&amp;D, board games and video games, as well as electronics projects and asking Tanya to paint, draw, or make something (like this website) for him (or one of his hobbies).</p>

      <h3>First Met</h3>
      <p>I was sitting in a practice session for the ACM Programming Competition with my other teammates, Kyler and Silas, and the other competition participants. Professor Harbert walked in with a timid girl with stunning red hair and introduced her to us as someone interested in the competition. I did not catch her name. We continued to work quietly until my team was stumped on a problem, at which time we asked the room for help. The timid girl (still nameless) had figured it out, and I was very impressed! After the practice was over and we went our separate ways, I was determined to find out who she was and, as I told Kyler that same day, date her.</p>
      <p>A few weeks passed and the competition loomed closer. Our team mentor, Professor Leftwich, sent out an email asking for individuals to reply back with their cell numbers, for his record. Thinking I was clever, I used "Reply All" instead of simply "Reply" in hopes that others, including the red-haired girl, would do the same. Unfortunately for me, while others did do the same she did not and I was left without her phone number even still. One good thing did come from this email. Professor Leftwich sent it to everyone coming to the competition and I was able to deduce that her name was Tanya Thompson.</p>
      <p>It was on the bus to the competition that we first introduced ourselves to each other. We didn't speak very much, just in general conversation with others on the bus. I can't remember how I got her number, all I remember is that the night before the conversation we stayed up far too late texting each other. I'm sure the guys I was rooming with didn't appreciate the light from my phone or my soft snickering at her (or my) jokes, but I didn't care. This was just the beginning. We enjoyed the competition (her team did better than mine) and spent the whole bus ride back privately texting each other while conversing out loud with the whole bus. This was the beginning.</p>

        <h3>From First Met to First Date</h3>
        <p>"There was a judge in a certain city," he said, "who neither feared God nor cared about people. A widow of that city came to him repeatedly, saying, 'Give me justice in this dispute with my enemy.' The judge ignored her for a while, but finally he said to himself, 'I don't fear God or care about people, but this woman is driving me crazy. I'm going to see that she gets justice, because she is wearing me out with her constant requests!'" -- Luke 18:2-5, NLT</p>
        <p>This verse reflects a term I have coined in getting Tanya to go on a date with me: <strong>persistent annoyance</strong>. We continued to talk in the months following the programming competition and I did everything in my power to get this girl to go on a date with me, which started with getting her to hang out with me. I did get to hang out with her quite a bit, but I wasn't always honest about my reasons for wanting (or needing) to hang out...</p>
        <p>One of my most favorite memories of this time is when I took a programming homework assignment that I had finished correctly, and that I knew Tanya had finished, and introduced errors (removed a few semicolons, for the tech-savvy) into it so that I could ask her to meet me somewhere and help me with it. She asked if she could just send me her code, but I was not having any of it. I was adament to get her to meet up with me. So we met up under OC's pavillion one night for me to get help. Ultimately, we fixed my "problem" and then spent the rest of the night getting to know each other better. It was awesome. It was the first step.</p>
        <p>Come November, my parents had purchased two Trans-Siberian Orchestra tickets for me as an early Christmas present and I thought I had the perfect first date to take Tanya on. She was at her grandparents for Thanksgiving, and TSO would be shortly after her return. I sent her a text over Thanksgiving break akin to "Hey, I like you, will you go on a date with me to a TSO concert in early December?" I received a text back: "Hey, we can go as <em>friends</em>." Dating Tanya was not going to be so easy after all. We did go to that concert as friends and I was more determined than ever to make this girl mine.</p>
        <p>Throughout the next few months, I continued to express interest in a relationship (read: persistently annoy her to date me) and Tanya continued to delay giving me an answer. That's right, she never said "no" but she never said "yes" either. Can you think of anything more frustrating for a teenaged boy? Me neither. We were attached at the hip, though, and our friendship was growing. Finally, in early February I asked her to go on a date with me and she said yes! Ultimately, I am thankful for the time I had to wait because it made the relationship much more important to me. I fought to get her, and I wasn't going to do anything to lose her.</p>

      <h3>Proposal</h3>
      <p>It was our 2-year annivarsary, and Corbin said we could have a picnic at the park. He brought me there, but hadn't brought any food! We walked and talked around one of the trails, and all the while I kept asking where our food was (I was starving, of course). When we got around to the pond, I saw that he had already set up our picnic. As we got to the table, I saw placeholders with our names on them. I got around to my side, and had to do a double-take; my placeholder didn't say "Tanya", but instead "Future Mrs. Murrow". I turned around, and he was down on one knee! I was totally surprised, but when I realized what was happening, I said yes!</p>
